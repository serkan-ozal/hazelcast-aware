1. What is Hazelcast-Aware?
==============

**Hazelcast-Aware** is a **Java Instrumentation API** based **Hazelcast** extension to use Hazelcast data structures (Distributed maps, lists, sets, queues, objects,  locks, topics, executers, entry listeners, etc ...) without interacting with **`HazelcastInstance`** class. You can specify which classes or fields will be Hazelcast aware by annotation or XML based configurations. **Hazelcast-Aware** scans classpath (classpath directories, dependent jar files and web application directories) of your application and finds Hazelcast aware classes and fields, then instruments them. Demo application is avaiable at [https://github.com/serkan-ozal/hazelcast-aware-demo](https://github.com/serkan-ozal/hazelcast-aware-demo).

2. Usage
=======

To find and make thses classes or fields Hazelcast aware, there are two ways:

1) You just need to call explicitly making aware method at startup in anywhere of your application.

~~~~~ java
...

com.hazelcast.aware.HazelcastAwarer.makeHazelcastAware();

...
~~~~~

or

2) You can extend your main class from **`com.hazelcast.aware.HazelcastAware`** class.

~~~~~ java
...

public class HazelcastAwareDemo extends HazelcastAware {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		...
	
	}
	
}	

...
~~~~~


3. Installation
=======

In your `pom.xml`, you must add repository and dependency for **Hazelcast-Aware**. 
You can change `hazelcast.aware.version` to any existing **Hazelcast-Aware** library version.
Latest version is `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

~~~~~ xml
...
<properties>
    ...
    <hazelcast.aware.version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</hazelcast.aware.version>
    ...
</properties>
...
<dependencies>
    ...
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
		<artifactId>hazelcast.aware</artifactId>
		<version>${hazelcast.aware.version}</version>
	</dependency>
	...

4. Features
=======

4.1. Hazelcast-Aware Class
-------

You can make any class Hazelcast aware by annotating it with **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareClass`** annotation.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass
public class HazelcastAwareBean {

	...
}
~~~~~

* **Instance name:**  You can associate Hazelcast aware class with specific Hazelcast instance by using **`instanceName`** attribute of **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareClass`** annotation. If you don't specified instance name, default Hazelcast instance is used.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass(instanceName = "myHazalcastInstance")
public class HazelcastAwareBean {

	...
}
~~~~~

4.2. Hazelcast-Aware Field
-------

You can make general configurations of any field defined in any Hazelcast aware class by annotating it with **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareMapField`** annotation.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass
public class HazelcastAwareBean {

	@HazelcastAwareMapField(instanceName = "myHazelcastInstance")
	private Map<Long, String> myMap;
	
	...
}	
~~~~~

* **Instance name:** You can associate Hazelcast aware field with specific Hazelcast instance by using **`instanceName`** attribute of **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareMapField`** annotation. If you don't specify instance name, Hazelcast instance of owner class is used. If instance name is not defined for class also, default Hazelcast instance is used.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass
public class HazelcastAwareBean {

	@HazelcastAwareMapField(instanceName = "myHazalcastInstance")
	private Map<Long, String> myMap;
	
	...
}	
~~~~~


4.3. Hazelcast-Aware Map Typed Field
-------

You can make any **`java.util.Map`** typed (or sub-typed) field, defined in any Hazelcast aware class, Hazelcast aware by annotating it with **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareMapField`** annotation.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass
public class HazelcastAwareBean {

	@HazelcastAwareMapField
	private Map<Long, String> myMap;
	
	...
}	
~~~~~

* **Map name:**  You can associate this map field to any distributed map on Hazelcast cluster by using **`name`** attribute of **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareMapField`** annotation. If you don't specify map name, default map name is generated by using **`<class_name>_<field_name>`** format.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass
public class HazelcastAwareBean {

	@HazelcastAwareMapField(name = "myMap")
	private Map<Long, String> myMap;
	
	...
}	
~~~~~

4.4. Hazelcast-Aware List Typed Field
-------

You can make any **`java.util.List`** typed (or sub-typed) field, defined in any Hazelcast aware class, Hazelcast aware by annotating it with **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareListField`** annotation.

~~~~~ java
@HazelcastAwareClass

}	
~~~~~

* **List name:**  You can associate this list field to any distributed list on Hazelcast cluster by using **`name`** attribute of **`com.hazelcast.aware.config.provider.annotation.HazelcastAwareListField`** annotation.
